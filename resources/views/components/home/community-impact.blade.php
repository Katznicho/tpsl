                    At Fountain of Peace, our dedication extends beyond supporting the children in our care. We are committed to bringing transformative solutions to the vulnerable communities around us. Over 300 vulnerable children are getting a quality education through our Rwenjaza Hillside Nursery and Primary School. Through this, we are equipping them with the knowledge and skills needed to break the cycle of poverty and build a brighter future.

                    Moreover, addressing the critical need for clean water has been one of our primary objectives. We have successfully constructed more than 20 wells, ensuring nearby communities can access safe, life-sustaining water. This initiative promotes better health and empowers communities to thrive and prosper. We also have an initiative called Mothers Matter in childbirth, through which we support pregnant mothers to get the medical attention they need. This way, we promote safe childbirth.

                    Our mission is guided by compassion and a deep-seated belief that every child and community deserves the opportunity to flourish. We are immensely grateful for the support and collaboration of those who share our vision. Together, we will continue to make a significant and positive impact in the lives of those we serve.
