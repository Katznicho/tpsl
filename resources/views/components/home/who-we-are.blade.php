                    Peace Ruharuza founded the Fountain of Peace in 2005, driven by a firm conviction to help rural, orphaned, and abandoned children. Her commitment stemmed from her childhood experiences, which deeply affected her and many of her friends. She found hope through the kindness of a stranger, leading her to believe that we have a responsibility to show the same compassion and mercy to others that we have received ourselves.

                <p class="text-gray-600 mb-6">
                    Since its inception, Peace has been joined by hundreds of supporters worldwide, creating a global community dedicated to giving abandoned and destitute children a chance to survive, thrive, and reach their full potential. Together, we rescue children, build loving homes, create families, and raise leaders based on a solid Christian foundation.
