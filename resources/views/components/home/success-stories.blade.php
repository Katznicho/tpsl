                    <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">On March 5th, Fountain of Peace responded to a call from Kyenjojo District's Senior Probation and Social Welfare Officer about Baby Patrick, a three-week-old infant in need of alternative care after his mother, Annet Kebirungi, passed away on March 1st due to a sudden illness. Annet left behind six children under the care of their father, Chris, who was overwhelmed by the responsibility, prompting intervention. Upon arrival, Baby Patrick was healthy, weighing 3.6 kg and feeding well. Fountain of Peace welcomed Patrick as our newest baby, providing him with care and support and ensuring a safe and nurturing environment where he can thrive.</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">Thank you for your interest in Patrick's story. Together, we can make a difference in the lives of more children like him.</p>
